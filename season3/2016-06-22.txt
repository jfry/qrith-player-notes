The Pissing Ambush

Rakas To'Ren: Mike
Feroz Ka: Jeff
Kendrell vir Militanas: Seth
Verin Ayende: Bryce
Tasran Sulum: Micah

Following the horse and cart tracks west along the river from the Vir Leran estate, the party runs across a man taking piss against a rock. He quickly mounts a horse and the party attempts to ride him down. But another unseen man pulls a rope up across the path at chest level, forcing Tasran, Kendrell, and Feroz from their horses. Rakas and Verin avoided the rope trap by attempting to cut off the pissing rider by taking a shortcut alongside the river. Once the party has caught up to and engaged with the rider, other men appear on the adjacent rocks and begin firing crossbow bolts. One of the men on the rocks turns out to have some magical abilities, initially ineffective, but upon a second attempt manages to render the entire party nauseated. In attempting to evade the party--using magic--moves aside but falls and is killed by Rakas. One other figure appears in the distance with a crossbow, and Verin is the first to approach and engage with him.

Kendrell runs to join Verin. Tasran runs in the direction of the unconscious combatant. Suddenly Kendrell, Tasran, and Verin are rendered blind. Rakas and Feroz are unaffected. Rakas sees that the formerly unconscious combatant is now on his feet again and walking nonchalantly. He shouts to head to the cart, but then notices Rakas and is surprised, and then concerned when he is able to establish eye contact. He shouts to head to the river, and he and the combatant formerly engaged with Verin head south. Rakas pursues. Kendrell and Tasran shout that they've been blinded. Feroz goes to Tasran's aid. Verin attempts to detect magic as a way to get some sort of information to compensate for his lack of sight. Kendrell and Verin stand back-to-back to try to have some sort of protection while they wait for aid from a sighted member of the party.

Rakas pursues the combatant presumably responsible for the blindness, who jumps into the icy river. Rakas changes direction and approaches the combatant near Kendrell and Verin. Rakas swiftly decapitates the combatant and then rushes to see if he can catch up with the swimmer.

The swimmer reaches the far side of the river, emerges, and disappears into the woods.

The pissing man appears to match the description of Radsel that the bodyguard Essad provided us.

General Loot:
- 35 gp
- small jar of sweet-smelling syrupy substance

Radsel Loot:
- long sword
- 2 daggers
- 2 flasks hard liquor
- purse with 34 gp
- 50 gp Zistown trade bar

- a Q'resti ledger of accounts for Vir Leran estate
- small chest, locked; ornamented with a hunting horn bearing the letters "VL"

Tasran finesses the lock on the chest releasing four darts that hit him, knocking him unconscious. Verin stabilizes Tasran and heals him.

Kendrell pokes at the chest while Verin is tending to Tasran. Rakas keeps watch. The chest blasts searing white light, blinding Kendrell and emits an annoying alarm.

Tasran eventually regains consciousness, opens the chest while it is wrapped in a blanket. In it we find:

A bag, containing gold, platinum, emeralds, ~2600 gp
A ring, "VL" signet ring
A dagger in a sheath, masterwork; very dark steel; "VL" on the blade (magical)
Chest itself is probably a $5000 dealie

The party gathers the bodies and weapons and then goes to find the cart, which they do. It is stacked with food.

The party strips the bodies, and finds the same tattoos on all of them. The party burns the serf bodies, piles the weapons and serf clothes onto the cart along with Radsel's body and heads back to the Vir Leran estate.
